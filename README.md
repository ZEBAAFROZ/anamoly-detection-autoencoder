Welcome to the Anomaly Detection Using Autoencoders GitHub repository! This project aims to showcase the implementation of anomaly detection using autoencoder neural networks. Anomalies or outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the normal patterns in a dataset. Autoencoders are a type of neural network architecture that can be used for unsupervised learning tasks, including anomaly detection.

## Introduction

Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, manufacturing quality control, and more. Autoencoders, a type of artificial neural network, have shown promising results in capturing underlying data distributions and identifying anomalies.

This repository provides an end-to-end example of building an anomaly detection system using an autoencoder. We demonstrate the entire process, from preparing the dataset to evaluating the model's performance.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZEBAAFROZ/anomaly-detection-autoencoder.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Dataset**: Prepare your dataset or use the example dataset provided in the `data` directory. More details about the dataset can be found in the [Dataset]('http://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/data/ecg.csv') section.

4. **Training**: Train the autoencoder model by running the training script:

   ```bash
   python Autoencoder_AnomalyECG2.py
   ```

5. **Inference**: After training, you can use the trained model to detect anomalies in your dataset. An inference script is provided for this purpose:

   ```bash
   python Autoencoder_AnomalyECG2_test.py
   ```

## Dataset

Describe your dataset here. Include details like the source of the dataset, its format, and any preprocessing steps applied. If possible, provide a link to download the dataset or instructions on how users can obtain it.

## Autoencoder Architecture

Explain the architecture of your autoencoder model. Provide details about the number of layers, type of layers (e.g., fully connected, convolutional), activation functions, and any other relevant information. You can include a diagram or code snippet showcasing the model architecture.

## Usage

Explain how users can use your project for their own anomaly detection tasks. Provide clear instructions for training the model on a custom dataset and using it for inference. You can also mention any configuration options or hyperparameters that users can adjust.

## Results

Share the results of your anomaly detection experiments. This could include visualizations, evaluation metrics, and comparisons with baseline methods if applicable.
